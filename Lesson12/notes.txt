Its going to be super fun!

EIP
EIP - Ethereum Improvement Proposals
ERC - Ethereum Request for Comments
once an EIP gets verified and accepted - an ERC is created

ERCs & EIPs are listed/made chronologically -> they share the same number

ERC-20 is a token and a smart contract standard - both
A standard interface for tokens.
This standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.

Why make an ERC20?
 - Governance token
 - Secure an underlying network
 - Create a synthetic asset

to build a ERC20, we just have to write a smart contract that follows the token standard



MANUALLY CREATING AN ERC20 TOKEN

Instead of manually creating a token everytime, we can use OpenZeppelin library to get a boiler plate code.
OpenZeppelin is considered as the standard library for solidity

and also this one good thing of ERC20 standard is this 'allowance' mapping that helps us set addresses that would be able to interact with our tokens
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public allowance;
