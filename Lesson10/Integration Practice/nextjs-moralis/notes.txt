yarn add moralis react-moralis

initializeOnMount = {false} means hey we don't want to host our app to a server right now

you don't even need to create a connect function, just use { enableWeb3 } from useMoralis() hook.

same with the execute function:
get the abi in a constants folder
and use { runContractFunction } = useWeb3Contract({
    pass in the parameters,abi, contractAddress and everything
})

//btw we got useWeb3Contract from useMoralis() hook only

look into the ethereum-boilerplate on github - have plugins for all those different injectors
